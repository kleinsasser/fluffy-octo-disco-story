There once was a very insecure fluffy octopus called Olly. He was extremely insecure because when he went to the fluffy octopus disco, he waved his eight tenticles at a much shorter wave length than all the
other fluffy octopi. The other fluffy octopi made fun of him for how quickly he waved his tenticles, but Olly thought it made him unique. Despite his wavey conviction to remain a special fluffy octopus,
he was still hurt by the rude words of his peers. He remained this way until he was so fed up with all the haters that he made a plan that would halt their bullying for good...

Then he grabbed the nearest puffer fish and ninja tossed his puffy butt right at the haters
and then they swelled up and died. He became a underwater god and now ruled the oceaon with his fluffy ass body

Then he build an underwater castle and spent the rest of his days there.

And he lived happily ever after.
